# How to run app

- npm install
- npx react-native start

# Enhancements that still need to be done

- Bottom tab icons are not changed on focus because the Design provided did not provide the same icons with gray or different color
- Pixels of margins, paddings, and any styles need to get resized. A resize function needs to get implemented to accomplish having a responsive UI and a UI that matches the design dimensions provided (A calculation that takes both in consideration: 1- The dimension of screens being used in design by designers 2- The screen dimensions of the users device)
- Some functions can be enhanced in the future
